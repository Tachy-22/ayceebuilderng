AYCEEBUILDER NIGERIA - ENTERPRISE TRANSFORMATION PLAN
From Hobby Project to Enterprise-Grade Construction Materials Marketplace
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================
This document outlines the comprehensive transformation required to evolve the 
current AyceeBuilder Nigeria platform from a hobby-level project utilizing 
Google Sheets as a data backend to a fully enterprise-grade construction 
materials marketplace comparable to industry leaders like eBay, Jumia, or 
Amazon for construction materials.

CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS
