Hi! Beyond the Google Places API, I recommend we
   also migrate to a proper production database
  for long-term success.

  CURRENT SETUP:
  Firebase (tied to personal accounts, limited
  scalability)

  RECOMMENDED UPGRADE:
  ✅ Supabase Database Migration
  - Company-owned account (not personal)
  - Better performance & scalability
  - More professional setup
  - Easier team management

  FULL HANDOVER PACKAGE:
  ✅ Complete codebase cleanup & documentation
  ✅ Zip entire project with instructions✅
  Transfer all accounts to company ownership
  ✅ Database migration to company Supabase
  account
  ✅ Remove all personal dependencies

  BENEFITS:
  - Product fully separated from any individual
  - Company owns 100% of the platform
  - Better foundation for future improvements
  - Easier to hire new developers
  - Professional development setup

  COST: ₦100,000 (one-time)
  TIMELINE: 1 week after Google Places API

  This ensures Ayceebuilder is completely
  independent and ready for growth. No more
  personal account dependencies!

  Want to bundle this with the Google Places
  upgrade for ₦150,000 total?

  ---
  This positions it as a professional upgrade that
   gives them full control and ownership.
